# Getting Started

This Repositry contains all Java Questions for Exams. This Covers 90% of the syllabus of SY BSc IT Core Java.
This Repo may also contain additional programs out of the scope of BSc IT Core Java course, which I did just for practice and learning Java.

To run Java Programs:

- Download and Install JDK Development Kit. [Click Here](https://www.oracle.com/in/java/technologies/downloads/)
- Download and Install any IDE, preferably VSCode. [Click Here](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
- Read this Documentation on more info about how to run Java Codes in VsCode. [Click Here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/java#:~:text=In%20order%20to%20run%20Java,Amazon%20Corretto)

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies
- `bin`: the folder to maintain compiled output files
- `.vscode`: my [Visual Studio Code IDE](https://code.visualstudio.com/) settings

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).

### What is Java?

Java is a programming language and a platform. It is a high-level object oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems. It is a simple programming language, widely used in development of Web Apps, Mobile Apps, Standalone Apps and Enterprise Apps. Java creates JRE (Java Runtime Environment) which is why it is known as a Platform.
