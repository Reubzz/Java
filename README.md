# Getting Started

This Repositry contains all Java Source codes of various programs. I did for practice and learning Java.

To run Java Programs:

- Download and Install JDK Development Kit. [Click Here](https://www.oracle.com/in/java/technologies/downloads/)
- Download and Install any IDE, preferably VSCode. [Click Here](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
- Read this Documentation on more info about how to run Java Codes in VsCode. [Click Here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/java#:~:text=In%20order%20to%20run%20Java,Amazon%20Corretto)

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies
- `bin`: the folder to maintain compiled output files
- `.vscode`: my [Visual Studio Code IDE](https://code.visualstudio.com/) settings

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
